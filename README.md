TL081CP OPAMP from Texas Instruments to plotthe gain vs frequency and phase vs frequency plots
The steps followed are as below :
 Supply +15 and -15 input voltage to the opamp along with a common ground connection
 Supplt input voltage of 1 V and varied frequency between 10 Hz to 300 KHz
 Observe ouput via oscilloscope while measuring the peak to peak voltage and delta x
