we have used the TL081CP OPAMP from Texas Instruments to plotthe gain vs frequency and phase vs frequency plots
The steps followed are as below :
 Supplied +15 and -15 input voltage to the opamp along with a common ground connection
 Supplied input voltage of 1 V and varied frequency between 10 Hz to 300 KHz
 Observed ouput via oscilloscope while measuring the peak to peak voltage and delta x
